This contains the R codes for siumulation and real data analysis for our project 'Discovering Candidate Genes Regulated by GWAS Signals in Cis and Trans'. This study introduces a novel approach to discover candidate genes regulated by GWAS signals in both cis and trans. We utilize adaptive statistical metrics (like Berk Jones test statistic and the Higher Criticism test statistic) that can reflect both the strong, sparse effects of cis-eQTLs and the weak, dense effects of trans-eQTLs, thereby helping us uncover joint effects that include functional impact of GWAS loci residing in non-coding regions. We apply our proposed method to adipose eQTL data from the METabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) study to identify genes playing important roles in the regulatory networks influencing cardiometabolic traits.
